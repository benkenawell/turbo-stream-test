# Turbo Express Demo

This repo is an absolute minimum example of what it takes to load a turbo stream.

## Download and install

1. have node installed
1. clone the repo
1. run `npm install`, this will download the only dependency: [express](https://expressjs.com/)

## Run the example

1. in this directory, run `npm start`
1. open a browser to the address printed to the console, it will likely be http://localhost:7155

## Modifying the code

There is no hot reloading (at all) in this example repo.  After making any changes to the code in this repo, you will need to shut down the server (Ctrl + C in the terminal where it is running) and restart it (`npm start` again).
